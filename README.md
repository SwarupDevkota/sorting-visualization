# sorting-visualization
Demo
https://lioninthewild.github.io/sortingVisualizer/


I created this project to visually analyze different types of sorting algorithms. It is a web app where the algorithms sort the list of elements in ascending order. I have created a very simple UI which allows the user to select the size of the array and set the speed of the algorithm they want to perform. It visualizes the following sorting algorithms : 


1. Selection Sort
2. Merge Sort
3. Quick Sort
4. Heap Sort
5. Insertion Sort 


Features


1. Choice among five sorting algorithms to visualize
2. You can generate a new array anytime of different heights.
3. You can change the size of the array generation.
4. You can set the speed of the animation.
5. Time and space complexities of the algorithm.


How to run?


1. You can use the source code from the SortingVisualizer repository available here. 
https://github.com/lioninthewild
You can clone the whole repository to your local space and run it easily on your local computer. You need to be logged in to GitHub for doing that. In case you find it hard to clone, here is the documentation on how to clone a GitHub repository to your local computer.  https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop


2. You can just enjoy the project on my site by going through the demo link above.


  Controls


1. Click on ‘Generate New Array’ to create a random array of certain elements.
2. You can play around with the ‘size of the array’ and ‘speed of the algorithm’ buttons.
3. Click on different available algorithms to see how each one performs. 


            Note: When one button is active, all the other buttons are disabled.
